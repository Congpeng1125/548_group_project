During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\'s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased). \n\n* Hilarious and devastating turn based combat for up to 8 players\n* Local multiplayer with optional AI opponents\n* Battle on an infinite number of randomly generated maps with over 31 environments, or choose from 48 set image maps\n* Utilise 55 (and counting) devastating weapons!

Very few, unless you\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive? Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game.

Please see below for directions.\n\nOptia is a beautiful, immersive physics game about reflected light. You must activate all targets in each level with a laser beam, powering the transition to the next.\n\nFortunately, your puzzle-solving instincts come in handy here! Using a clever assortment of mirrors, you can reflect a beam in any direction, split it into two separate beams (or four, or eight, or sixteen...), and if you must, sacrifice your own laser to clear a path to that last target.\n\nAnd Optia doesn't end there! After cutting your teeth on the main campaign, you can create your own levels and upload them for others to play.\n\nWith 100 main levels, more than one thousand user-created levels, and a polished ecosystem for creating, playing, and rating new levels, you never really need to stop playing Optia.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.""",fishdog.net,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, NO, SV, TR",50140160,Games,"Games, Strategy, Card, Entertainment",11/02/2010,20/06/2019,Strategy,206220,15507.744,1979.712,0,395942.4
