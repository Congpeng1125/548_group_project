The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.\n\nThe main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted 'S'. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.\n\nWhen moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponent's pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to 'jump' over an opponent if it isn't part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.\n\nThrough symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If one's piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.\n\nSenet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.\n\nFor more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.""",RoGame Software,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, EL, IT, JA, KO, NO, PT, RU, ZH, ES, SV",34689024.0,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Education",18/07/2008,22/07/2018,Strategy,560.0,42.112

It's not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and you'll get hooked.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective:\nYou have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.\n\n\u2022 Tips:\nUsing the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word 'PaintBall' on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!\n\n\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose.\n\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups.\n\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning!\n\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.\n\nFEATURES\n* award winning gameplay\n* hours of gameplay craziness - mania guaranteed\n* many modes to play\n* fast playing ideal for waiting rooms/buses\n* Export Hi-Scores to internet\n* change ball styles\n\nPRESS:\n-----\nUIQ 2008 Open Winner for the games category! \n-----\ngamefreaks365: So, do you need Paintball 2?

When one stone lands on another of the same color, this stone as well as all bordering stones of the same color disappear. The goal is, of course, to empty the field \u2013 so far, so good.  \n\nYet, this simple concept leads to surprisingly challenging functions, and the variety of strategic possibilities make Pebbles an absorbing game. \n\nA shelf above the playing field shows which stone is going to come next. Knowing which stone is going to follow is a deciding factor in the game\u2019s strategy. \n\nChoosing the sequence of the moves with care is also very important: a well positioned pebble can do more than just eliminate others; it can also be the basis for up coming moves, just as a badly positioned pebble can prove to be terribly obstructive.  \n\nThe level of difficulty increases with the number of pebbles that are in the playing field at the start of a game as well as the number of different colors.",Objective Development,4+,"EN, DE",10136576.0,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Entertainment",28/04/2009,20/01/2016,Strategy,17320.0,1302.464

The remaining 20% are \nopen to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called ""tramp"" ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.\n\nThe Object of the Game\n\nEach player founds his own shipping \ncompany, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market.\nThen the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.\n\nAfter unloading his cargo, the captain \nis credited with the agreed payment.\nThen he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.\n\nA player\'s chances of success improve \nthe more he knows about international \nshipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.\n\nBut the game is not a pure economic game, \nalso a ship simulator is integrated, and\nthe captain can steer his ship manually,\neither if necessary, or to save money and\nget a good status.\n\nIn summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind: \n""Software with Hard Facts.""\n\n\nlatest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example).\nTo avoid the burglar, visit your office in a regular interval.  \n\n\nhomepage: www.portsofcall.de\nsupport: www.rdkleinforum.de",Dipl.-Ing.

The rules are very well explained and the tutorial is short and easy to understand. The game offers both diverting relaxation for small pauses or for bridging a gap between appointments and real challenges for combination skills in the higher levels. Conclusion: real fun!\u201d\n\u2013 obstfreund\n\nGreat little Brain Burner\n\u201eIf you enjoy a good puzzler, WORP is for you. I think the instructions could be a bit clearer, but a game or two will make things click. Very groovy ambient techno soundtrack. Well worth the dough they are asking for it.\u201c\n\u2013 Ortho123\n\nYour brow is furrowed in concentration. So far, you\u2019ve only managed to turn some of the primary bits into combined bits. That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory.\n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck.\n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP has to offer.\n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once. This application has three difficulty levels and nine different memories, which increase in difficulty as they go.\n\nIf you need to take a little break because your brain is overheating, WORP lets you save your game and come back to where you left off.\n\nWORP provides the atmospheric sounds that complete the experience for you. You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n- Game center integration (Leaderboards + Achievements)\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do.

However,if more enemies hit on the skull tower, the health bar of the tower will decrease to a point it will be destroyed to ground.

You can also exchange all your soul points to repair your skull tower. \n\n\nSpells to research or upgrade:\n\n- Mana capacity - this is the ability to cast your spells. If you run out of mana, you cannot cast any more spells and your tower will be in danger. \n\n- Chain lightning damage - you can increase your damage of this spell to greater heights.\n\n- Hellfire - a fire from the hell that will burn your enemies to ashes. It works by drawing a circle over the affected area on the screen. The hellfire will ignite and set enemies within the chosen area on fire.\n\n- Frozen Touch - this spell will freeze your enemies and you can increase the duration for which they are frozen to delay time.\n\nIt works by double tapping the enemies to freeze them.

Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game. Entire family from 3 to 83 loves it""\n\n""This may be the winner on my list of \'Most addictive games for the iPad.\' My daughter is addicted, I\'m addicted and my mother is addicted!

It\'s up to you to save the galaxy.\n\nTo successfully complete you mission you must destroy all swarmers and protect at least two (2) space stations and two (2) planets from destruction without yourself being destroyed.

You maneuver your ship across the galaxy, destroying swarmers before they can destroy inhabited planets and space stations. \n\nThe game is played turn-by-turn.

It's now 4am, and I've hardly scratched the surface of the depth of this game. \n\u2022 I now have a fun, engaging, thought provoking RPG on my iPhone, an RPG that fits in my purse and that I can play any time I want, not having to have my computer or Xbox 360 near me to do so. \n\u2022 If Bioware remade Civilization they'd be lucky to end up half as good as King of Dragon Pass.\n\u2022 It's impossible to describe the emotional tug you feel when an old and trusted advisor, who you've watched grow from a young upstart, dies of old age. Or when an exploration team disappears into the wilds, never to be heard from again. Or when a cursed clansman, shunned by his peers, sacrifices himself to stop a raid. This game will never leave my iPhone. That's the only accolade possible.\n\nThe game is completely accessible via VoiceOver.\n\nBe sure to check out Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind, the spiritual successor!""","A Sharp, LLC",12+,EN,364954624.0,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Role Playing",14/02/2011,18/10/2018,Entertainment,19200.0,1443.8400000000001

For 20 years, the Earth has been under the rule of the Global Confederation that united and brought under its control all the countries and continents.   The mankind entered a new era. Global territory wars that had been waged for a century subsided. The world economy no longer supported the military machine to be ready for action and turned towards the progress. The new scientific horizons on the Earth and in outer space were open. \n\nBut peace and quite in the Confederation is being increasingly disturbed by the outbreaks of rebellions of those who oppose the Senat's policies. The resistance movement is gaining momentum all over the world. The Senate throws the whole reserve of Condederation's scarce peace-keeping forces to suppress the rebellion.\n\nIn the east of Peru, near the city of Pucallpa, some signs of rebellious activity have been observed. Prior to that moment, South America was the calmest of regions. Your mission is to crush the revolt in Peru and to capture the leader of the rebellion.\n\nYou are charged with a mission on which the future of mankind depends. As a general of Confederation you are to suppress a revolt in Peru.\n\nTo attain the goal you must complete 7 missions of the campaign on diverse terrains from the Amazonian jungle to the mountain ranges of the Andes. The game features a variety of machinery, facilities and upgrades. Each side has unique equipment with its features and fighting qualities and so its own tactics.

Please see below for directions.\n\nOptia is a beautiful, immersive physics game about reflected light. You must activate all targets in each level with a laser beam, powering the transition to the next.\n\nFortunately, your puzzle-solving instincts come in handy here! Using a clever assortment of mirrors, you can reflect a beam in any direction, split it into two separate beams (or four, or eight, or sixteen...), and if you must, sacrifice your own laser to clear a path to that last target.\n\nAnd Optia doesn't end there! After cutting your teeth on the main campaign, you can create your own levels and upload them for others to play.\n\nWith 100 main levels, more than one thousand user-created levels, and a polished ecosystem for creating, playing, and rating new levels, you never really need to stop playing Optia.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score.

You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game. \n\nEach player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized. \n\nIf the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player\'s claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.\n\nRefer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game. \n\nAs few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it. If you draw a winning or kong tile, push multiple tiles forward to show your hand.    \nYou can move and rearrange the tiles at will.  To have them sorted automatically, do a hoizontal swipe above your hand.\n\nOn iPad, it supports layout on the larger screen in both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nA convenient feature, especially for single handheld play on the iPhone, is you can also click on the hand button to claim a tile or declare a win.\n\nYou can adjust the game speed and sound.  You can also control that hands be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand.\n\nChoose  ""Align discarded tiles"" to line discarded tiles neatly, else discarded tiles are spinned and placed randomly.\n\nYou can choose to play flower and season tiles.\n\nYou can change the the color of the background and tiles, or use a picture as the game background. \n\nMultitask switching on supported iOS. Game is paused when you switch away from the App and automatically resumed when you return. Resume button is still used to resume game saved if App is terminated (or for older iOS without multitask support).\n\nThe players bank will be shown at the start of the game.

The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time.

You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck. \n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP HD starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP HD has to offer. \n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once.

With the most powerful Go software available for the iPhone or iPod Touch, Igowin Pro will challenge you no matter what your level, and keep you at the top of your game, on small boards or full size. \n \nIgowin Pro uses the same Go engine as The Many Faces of Go, the three time world computer Go champion. It draws on more than two and a half decades of experience, a massive knowledge base and the newest research, as well as modern Monte Carlo techniques to help you learn and grow as a player. This is, hands down, the strongest Go engine available for the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nIgowin Pro supports play on 9x9, 13x13, or 19x19 boards.   This flexible program lets you set your rank as you like.  Game parameters can be set up automatically based on your playing level, or you can choose whatever opponent strength or handicap you want.\n\nA built in \u201cmagnifying glass\u201d helps you put your move exactly where you want it.  Smart move technology snaps your stone into the correct position.  The convenient ""instant-undo"" feature lets you reset a mis-tap without waiting for the computer to finish thinking.\n\nGames can be saved, commented, and emailed as attachments for later study to help improve your play. \n \nIgowin Pro has the most comprehensive tutorial of any app of its kind. You can learn the game basics quickly and begin playing immediately.  You can ask for a hint or an estimate of the current score anytime during a game.  With no complex menus and just a few basic controls, the game is easy to navigate.\n\nAll AI levels are calibrated by actual play, on an online server. That means that the ranking Igowin gives you is very close to what your real-world ranking would be, rather than an arbitrary number that only applies within the app. \n \nIgowin Pro uses the traditional Kyu ranking system to measure your performance. The engine automatically adjusts its level of play to match yours. By using the calibrated rankings within the Go engine, it can play a 9x9 even game, with no handicaps, against any player, from beginner all the way up to 3 Dan level.  19x19 even games automatically adjust from beginner to 3 Kyu. \n \nWhether you\'re a rookie looking for a fun way to learn and play the game of Go, or a crafty veteran looking for a challenge, Igowin is the app you\'ve been searching for. Take Igowin Pro wherever you go, and play it whenever you have a few minutes to burn.

All of the warfare is carried out by enormous military robots.\nThe player controls a flying machine which can fly over any part of the play-area. The player must build robots and give them orders to attack Insignian robots and capture neutral or enemy factories to increase production and thus aid the war effort. The ultimate objective is to capture all the enemy bases and thus win the war. Everything takes place in real-time with the action being ongoing rather than turn-based.

Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little blighters with a bad attitude!\n\nIn other words Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.\n\nAs commander, it\'s your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.\n\nEach player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\'s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased). \n\n* Hilarious and devastating turn based combat for up to 8 players\n* Local multiplayer with optional AI opponents\n* Battle on an infinite number of randomly generated maps with over 31 environments, or choose from 48 set image maps\n* Utilise 55 (and counting) devastating weapons! Defeat your foes with simple weapons like Grenades or take it to the next level and trash entire landscapes with weapons like the Melon Bomb or Piano Strike\n* Play the game your way, with 25 different game modifiers, tweak almost every aspect of the match\n* Customize your team, with over 280 costumes, 32 graves, 13 forts, 100s of flags and unique voice packs\n* Huge battles with up to 64 hogs",Anton Malmygin,9+,"BG, DA, EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, PL, PT, RO, RU, ES, TR",181682176.0,Games,"Games, Casual, Strategy",16/09/2010,2/04/2018,Casual,6820.0,512.864

You start out with quiescence of the elements, but you have to change faith to your advantage. You need a good strategy to break the quiescence \nto your advantage. But be careful, your opponent will try the same thing and you might end up loosing most of you Taijitu pieces that symbolize your faith. \n\n- Yin and Yang takes place between two players. The first player symbolizes the Yin, the second player symbolizes the Yang \n\n-It is played on an 8x8 board of 64 squares. There are 64 Taijitu pieces, colored black for player representing Yin and gold for the player representing Yang. \n\n- In the basic game, the board is set up initially with two Taijitu pieces for each player. The advanced games (Challenge and Master) have more pieces on the initial board) \n\n- Yang (black Taijitu) makes the first moved. Players are then taking alternate turns. \n\n- When making your move, you can change faith by forcing pieces on the board to change from Yin to Yang or Yang to Yin. \n\n- Goal of the game is, once all the pieces are placed to have more pieces than your opponent on the board. \n\n- At each turn a player must place a Taijitu piece with their color face up on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponent's Taijitu piece, such that one or \nmore straight lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) are formed from the newly placed disc, through one or more of the opponent's discs and up to other Taijitu pieces of their own color already \non the board. All the intervening Taijitu pieces of the opponent's color are flipped to the faith (Yin/Yang) of the newly laid Taijitu piece. \n\n-Taijitu pieces may be flipped from one faith to the other but once played are not moved from one square to another or removed from the board. \n\n- Players may not pass unless there is no valid move available to them in which case they must pass. \n\n-Play continues until neither player is able to move, usually when all 64 squares have been played. \n\n- The player with most piece of their faith wins \n\n\nHistory \n\nIn Chinese philosophy, the concept of yin yang, normally \nreferred to in the West as yin and yang) is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other \nin turn. The concept lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of \ndifferent forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (tai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung) and of I Ching divination. Many natural dualities \u2014 e.g. dark and light, \nfemale and male, low and high, cold and hot \u2014 are thought of as manifestations of yin and yang (respectively). \nYin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly \nin particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. The concept of yin and yang is often symbolized by various forms of the Taijitu symbol, for which it is probably best known in western cultures. \nThere is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to good and evil (not respectively). However, Taoist philosophy generally discounts good/bad distinctions and other \ndichotomous moral judgments, in preference to the idea of balance. Confucianism (most notably the philosophy of D. Zhongshu, circa the second century BCE) did attach a moral dimension to the idea \nof yin and yang, but the modern sense of the term largely stems from Buddhist adaptations of Taoist philosophy. \n\n---------------------- \nThis game is enabled for GameCenter and allows you to play against other players through GameCenter.""",Uwe Meier,4+,EN,24873984.0,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy",14/12/2010,10/11/2017,Board,500.0,37.6

You will have to fight various enemies and monsters, explore new territories, manage economic and scientific developments and solve a heap of unusual and unexpected tasks.

You are able to issue orders but heroes will follow your commands only for a sizeable reward. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" contains elements of role play: while fulfilling your orders, the heroes improve their skills and talents, as well as earn cash to be spent on new equipment, weapons, and magical elixirs. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" \u2013 the throne is waiting for its hero! \n\nGame Features: \n\n- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for iOS. \n- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armour. \n- A dozen types of monsters. \n- Several dozen spells. \n- 30 upgradeable building types. \n- 15 scenario missions+ a bonus one. \n- 3 difficulty levels. \n- About 100 game achievements. \n______________________________________ \n\n***** ""...Richest real-time strategy game I\u2019ve yet played on a phone or tablet, and also one of the more interesting games of this sort I have played on any system recently."" \u2013 The New York Times \n\n***** ""It\u2019s a great strategy game.

The pieces and their moves will be familiar to anyone that has played standard chess, which makes this an ideal game for players of all skill levels. Certain spaces on the board allow pieces to make special moves, some of which are simply mind-blowing. Special visual effects and sounds enhance play. You can play locally with friends or challenge yourself against 3 levels of artificial intelligence. You can play alone or in teams of 2 vs. 2.\n \nIf you like chess or chess variants, you can hardly afford to miss out on Warlord Chess.\n \nBut I don\u2019t know 4 good chess players...\nDon\u2019t worry! Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.\n \nMost importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!\n \nThat is a crazy looking board...\nThat\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.\n \nThe Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!\n \nThe Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard. These spaces enhance the way the Bishop, Rook, and Queen move. Beware the Queen in the Courtyard!\n \nBut I\u2019m Just Learning/No Good at Chess/Easily Confused...\nThen we have the *perfect* chess game for you. The interface was designed for everyone. Just touch a piece to see all the moves it can possibly make. Then tap the space you want it to move to. If you don\u2019t like it you can Cancel that move and try another. When you are sure of your move, you can press a button to Confirm it.\n \nIf you need practice, play a local game against a single opponent and set the AI to Easy. Increase the difficulty and number of players as you get better. You can even play team games and learn from your partner. There are so many options!\n \nWhat Have You Got For Us Experienced Players?\nWe\u2019ve got a lot. If you are *very* familiar with chess, then Warlord Chess will provide you with a brand new challenge. It is nearly impossible to control a board this big, especially against 3 players who are out to get you. So good luck with that. You can set the AI to \u201cHard\u201d in order to play against opponents that can see multiple moves ahead.\n \nWe\u2019ve also provided you with tools for analyzing your Warlord Chess games. You can save and load up to five games. With our Rewind, Forward, Start, and End buttons you can move through those games step-by-step so you can figure out why you lost, brainstorm some killer new moves, or relive past glories.\n \nWhat Else Have You Got?\nWe\u2019ve got a board that hovers and rotates over a roaring field of flame. We\u2019ve got special attacks for each of the four colors in the game. We\u2019ve got Secret Passages and a cool scoring system. And we\u2019ve got more on the way.

It is interesting mostly because it was coded entirely on an iPad in Lua using the Codea application from Two Lives Left.\n\nThe sprites in the game were drawn using Spritely, the sprite editor which comes with Codea.\n\nThe source code for this game and a description of how it was built is available for download at the Codea Tutorial site (http://codeatuts.blogspot.com.au/)\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear the grid without tapping any of the mines. If you tap a mine the game is over.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFrom the menu you can select Easy, Medium or Hard games. The difference in difficulty is determined by the size of the game grid and the number of mines.\n\nEasy - grid dimensions 8x8 with 8 mines\nMedium - grid dimensions 15x15 with 30 mines\nHard - grid dimension 18x18 with 60 mines\n\nThe game screen shows the number of cells not cleared in the top left hand corner and game duration on the right. Tapping on the game grid will reveal either an empty square or a mine.\n\nThe first tap is a gamble. In this version of Minesweeper it is possible for your first tap to be on a mine. Mines are placed randomly in different positions each game. If there are no mines surrounding the cell you tap then all of these cells will also be revealed at the same time. If there is a number in a revealed cell this indicates the number of mines in the surrounding cells. You can use this information to deduce the location of the mines.\n\nMathematically it has been shown that the highest chance of clearing multiple cells is by tapping in a corner.\n\nThere are three buttons on the game screen:\n\nShow/Flag: Tapping the shovel or flag icon at the bottom of the screen will toggle between show and flag mode. In show mode, tapping a cell will reveal it. In flag mode, tapping a cell will place a flag on it, indicating there may be a mine underneath. You don't have to use flags but they make the game easier to solve.\n\nNew: Will reset the grid and start a new game.\n\nMenu: If tapped will take you back to the Menu screen.\n\nHIGHSCORE:\n\nThe high score for each of the three game difficulties is stored. You get a high score by solving the grid in the shortest recorded time.""",Reefwing Software,4+,EN,6858752.0,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",31/08/2012,14/01/2016,Simulation,200.0,15.040000000000001

Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that\'s what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate west or east, and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nThis free ""Lite"" version of the game contains advertising.
